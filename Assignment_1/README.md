The first assignment from the Data Analysis course tasked us with identifying which factors were important when determining a Lending Club interest rate. The data we used was provided to us by the instructor, but has been uploaded to GitHub for reproducibility and can be found in the rawData file. Information regarding the data set can be found in the final writeup.
