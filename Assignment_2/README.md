The second assignment for the Data Analysis class tasked us with predicting movement based on accelerometer data from a smartphone. The rawData file contains the modified .rda data that was provided by the instructor. Details about the data can be found in the full writeup, as well as in the analyis2info pdf.  


The 'code' file contains both an R markdown file and the raw code. The former being much easier to read and follow, the latter being much easier to copy or edit. File location is crucial in R and reproducibility requires the exact same locations as this repository.
